i am a huge stalker fan

but stalcraft and stalker 2 isn't that enough

you won't have to play my hex game when there's titans

but i can totally see roguelike being a stalker spinoff

bear detector in hand, ppm and ukrainian comradery yes let's

i can throw in some metro, some ww1 and some half-life

this is really a vast hunt across an ever stretching industrial landscape

infused with advanced technologies, modern paranoias and mythology

the problem is that an amalgamation of themes is called an indie game

i don't want people to praise my yoghurt tomato butter soup and tell me it's good

good games have dumb premises

the medieval kingdom of the nords thrown in civil war (skyrim belongs to the nords)

i would love to make a game where people just load up a page and fucking play stalker

i wouldn't have to invent a vomit genre and tell people it's good
