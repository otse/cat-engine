it's the time of the roman era

a hostile force has swept the surface

romans have taken underground and built vast irrigation tunnels later called sewers

as roman civilization and culture slowly eroded undergrounds

a new kind of roman people formed from the filthied masses

they called themselves the usurpers and they used wooden swords covered in slime

because the surface was so hostile they couldn't find any metal ones

as time went on the darkened critters of the above started creeping into the failed infrastructure

the romans fought valourously to defend their crumbled culture

now after many years all that is left are caves, mines and shady romans

with spear and shield do they uphold the old ways of war

hunting for critters who have fallen or are lost in their mucky underworld
