this is just perfect

i think fantasy reverberates positively with players while cyber noir gives you that fear that your own life is a dystopia?

fantasy reminds people of fresh air, of the wind and of flowers. buildings are made of wood or stone, and there is an honesty and chivalry to things. you know when there is a slime or a toad that it's not a super big deal. how does that relate to cyber punk?

the dance of the dead is the casual fantasy theme players deserve.
