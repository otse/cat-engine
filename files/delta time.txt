delta time.txt for scrubs
the dt is inversely related to fps

that is dt = 1 / fps

if your fps is 30, your dt will be 0.0333 or 33.3 ms

if your fps is 1, the dt will be 1
if your fps is 2, the dt will be 0.5

in other words: it is the elapsed time since the last update

dt is very natural to work with because you can express speed per second

if i want a ball to move 100 pixels per second, you simply write: x += 100 * dt

if your pc is running very slowly, or stutters, the dt can become very large to keep up with the lag

but if your pc (monitor) is super speedy, the dt will be a very small number

for most computers the dt will be 0.016 (1/60 fps)
