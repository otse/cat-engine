wastes was a creative nightmare i won't even explain why just trust me it sucked

i think stalker has a fantastic theme

stalcraft and stalker 2 are popular

skyrim meets stalker would be nice. a place of guns, suits, masks and secrets

most great games have dumb premises

medieval simulator meets historic disaster area meets artefacts

skyrim has word walls and stalker has the wish granter

a tech bracer with an lcd screen is already boring me

the bayou from hunt showdown is a really nice arena for a 1800s shooter

all these games use history as a major feature

i love arabic cities like lut gholein, al kharid and baghdad
