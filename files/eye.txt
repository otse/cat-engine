eâ‘‚e is the eye divine stand off

my eye theme is more like eye divine and rimworld than fallout 1 and 2

it is half-life combined with the grit of cybernetic dystopias

eye takes place in an unknown waste land like a nevada or mojave. but that's boring, we've already seen dystopian ruins and dudes in exoskeletons. you explore a ruin. there's a dead guy with an advanced helmet. now i'm tougher. i'll toss on a visor or head lamp. everything is hyper-advanced!

here is a gameplay loop that i could maybe understand would be of interests to a budding player who is just looking for some casual fun, and a way to check back into the game world knowing he is going to advance, learn something or actually have fun.

so this...is not a massoschistic simulation at all. the game is just tough. you'll get it once you stepped on the tenth landmine and die, we promise.  hey, it's a roleplaying game. even cartons of milk will kill you.

eye: half-life. i will try to explain what is happening in my head right now.

what do you explore in half-life 2? dry canals made of concrete, old dams, large drain pipes, maintenance tunnels, flood tunnels, large infrastructures like docks, large depots, empty barns at the coutnryside and abandoned cottages at the coastal. it's all industrial.
